# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to build a website to store all of the information I've learnt throughout completing my prework for my bootcamp. I built this project to also utilize the information I was learning and to create a place that I can access from any computer to look over my notes. 

## Installation

## Usage

This study guide can be added to and looked over when ever I need to recall previous information about HTML, CSS, JavaScript or Git and it can hold the information I will learn throughout this bootcamp. Using the console panel, you can also determine a randomized subject to study.
